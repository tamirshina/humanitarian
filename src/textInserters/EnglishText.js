        <b>Education</b>

        Since the day of the foundation the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society great emphasis was given on education. By the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Palestine at the time, Israel of today, is notably neglected and the Ottoman authorities barely invests in infrastructure, education and medicine. Progress and development in these fields comes from external sources, both governments and private benefactors. The Russian Empire together with all its subjects are leading the way with their donations in these fields.
        Two principal ideas remained constant during the Society’s restorative plan of Palestine; the first was to   provide a framework of Orthodox education for the corresponding community residing in the Holy Land and the second was to support the local populations with quality education, for instance in the sciences, arithmetic, environmental studies and languages.
        Apart from the level of education, the Society creates facilities at standards unknown to the Holy Land; new constructions and quality equipment make the Orthodox education the wanted educational framework by many locals of Palestine, and the registration applications to the Society’s schools greatly outnumber the total capacity. As a result, the education-centered activity keeps spreading successfully around the Middle East; in addition to the first schools, the teacher seminars complement the overall activity, the facilities occupancy increases annually and the graduates keep on promoting the idea.
        
        In that period the Society operates two major educational centers, the first in Nazareth for males and the second in Beit Jala for females. Both centers functioned according to the format of boarding schools; the students and teachers resided in the complex premises. Furthermore, each one of these centers operated an infirmary that provided medical attention not only to the students and teachers, but also the local population. Aside of these two centers, the Society erected more schools in the Galilee and Yehuda; by 1899 there were already 23 schools and educational facilities in Palestine that served around 1,074 students. 497 were girls and 577 were boys. Eight years later the Society operates 101 schools serving more than 5,000 students.
        
        <b>Medicine</b>
        
        As part of the Society’s will to grant quality medical treatment to the pilgrims and the people entailed in the educational activities, IOPS invested vastly in order to create appropriate medical services in Palestine. The first and central project was the construction of an advanced hospital in Jerusalem. The costs of the hospital were nothing but frugal, and the ambition was to build the highest quality medical facility in that period’s Jerusalem. As time passed, additional services were introduced to the hospital like surgical rooms, an ambulatory clinic, a department for contagious diseases and others. The hospital served the pilgrims, the people of the Church and the locals of Jerusalem that were in dire need of medical attention and could not afford it. During certain years, the quantity of patients that did not belong to the Orthodox community constituted half or more of the overall quantity of patients treated. The hospital was a source of national pride for the Russian Empire owing both to its superior quality and to its contribution to the Orthodox community and the residents of Jerusalem.
        In the teachers seminars in Nazareth and in Beit Jala infirmaries were established with the same agenda of providing medical treatment to the members of the community and the local community in need. In addition, an ambulatory clinic was created in each of these two centers; the teachers received the respective training and were obliged to execute shifts in the infirmary.
        The number of patients treated in all the medical institutions created by the Society increased annually in a constant rate. For instance, in 1900 the total number of cases in the Society’s medical institutions was 83,743; eleven years later, in 1911, there were more than 127,000 recorded cases treated by the same institutions. During that period the hospital in Jerusalem is responsible for the largest number of patients.

        School Stories

This is my first day in the new school and I am very excited! My father has told me a lot about this school; he says that this school is like us, like my family. Here in my village all my friends are Muslim and such are their families; I love them greatly. My sisters, my brother and I are, like our mom and dad, Christians, and not just any Christians, but Orthodox Christians! I like praying and watching the icon of Jesus Christ in the red corner of the house (red corner – the corner of the house where it is customary to pray, the word for “red” in Russian is close to the word for “beauty”). Mom says that Jesus used to live not far from us, in Nazareth. Once, our family together with grandpa and grandma visited Nazareth but we did not meet him. Grandpa says that he is guarding us from the Heavens and that he is found in our hearts.

<b>The first night</b>

The new school is very beautiful, it is cleaner from the previous one and the chairs here are more comfortable. I am excited because in a while we will say the “Lord’s Prayer” for the first time all the children together and afterwards we will enter the first class with a teacher who believes, like us, in the Orthodox faith; she comes from a land far away, Russia. Dad says that it is colder there than here, but I do not understand how that can be. She came here on a boat from Russia because in the local school nobody talks about Jesus and the miracles he performed. She knows plenty about Jesus and Orthodoxy. She has blonde hair like I have never seen before, and she is very lovely!

<b>The second night</b>

Today was so much fun! I really like my new class; they are all girls and there are no annoying boys that pull others’ hair. We sang together all the prayers and the teacher talked to us about the miracle of the bread and the fish; I had never heard this story before in school, only at home. At 2 o’clock there was a delicious lunch and we blessed for the food; the teacher told us that if at our house we are not sure about the blessing, she can teach also our family how to bless properly. I am so excited to tell everyone.
Every afternoon, two children from the class help prepare the dining room and when we finish eating everybody cleans their plates. Nur that is in the class with me misbehaved during lunch and laughed during the prayer. The teacher said she will get punished.
I met Shiraz and we became best friends! She lives in Kfar Kana and I know where this is because my mom’s sister is from there and we visited her last summer. Shiraz and I received the assignment of cleaning the class in the end of the day; we played so long that we forgot and now we are tired and will go to sleep. Tomorrow we will get up earlier than the rest, even before the sun, and we will clean the class with a lamp before the teacher comes.

<b>The third night</b>

Ugh! We got caught...today in the morning, even before sunrise when Shiraz and I began to clean the classroom, Ismail, the school janitor, entered. He has the keys to all classrooms. He told our teacher, Maria. Maria loves us because we are good pupils and pray with full intention in our hearts; the punishment she gave us was to clean the classroom for a whole week but she told us that if we continue to behave well, it will only be two days. Nur molests a lot and got a greater punishment, she will have to recite the “Lord’s Prayer” at the end of the lesson for two weeks. This is a very hard punishment!
I still love my new school very much and I have a lot of new friends; On Friday we will get back home to our parents and I cannot wait to tell them everything.
Thank you our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, thank you.

        The hospital in Jerusalem was erected first and foremost in order to provide for the medical needs of the ever-increasing influx of Russian pilgrims reaching Palestine. A significant portion of the pilgrims was of old age and used to the climatic conditions of Russia. The long journeys in ships and the living conditions in Palestine during the late 19th and early 20th centuries took a heavy toll on the pilgrims thus the pressing need for medical attention. Moreover, the growing numbers of pilgrims, which reached an annual peak of nearly 12,000 men and women, further stressed the need for provision of quality medical services in Palestine; services which were not granted by the Ottoman rule.

Most of the admitted patients in the hospital were sojourners in the course of a life-changing quest,  which they would usually materialize during significant holidays in the christian calendar. The patients yearned for the quickest possible treatment so that they do not miss the tours to holy sites, the prayers, the visits to churches and monasteries and even the communal shared dinner. As a result large numbers of patients were eager to leave the hospital in the middle of their treatment, against doctors’ evaluations, so that they can reconnect to their friends for their quest in the Holy Land.

During the period of the Great Fast (the most important fast of the liturgical year for orthodox Christianity) great numbers of pilgrims would avoid consumption of superfluous meals and quench their appetite with most modest food abstaining from dairy products, eggs and meat. Numerous pilgrims observed the fast even during hospitalization and hence they preserved the feeling of religious elevation, even though sometimes the fast weakened them and affected their medical condition. 

Amidst this period in Jerusalem there were additional hospitals; they were also operated by foreign governments and private benefactors and each provided an inferior number of beds compared to the Russian hospital – the big German hospital contained 40 beds, the French hospital had 32 beds, the English hospital 27 beds, the Greek hospital 25 beds, the Jewish hospital “Bikur Cholim” contained 25 beds and the Rothschild Jewish hospital had 18 beds while the Russian hospital had a capacity of 75 beds.

Apart from the hospital beds, the Russian hospital contained a surgery room and a contagious illnesses department. From data collected by the Society it is seen that by the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century one third of the admitted patients suffered from malaria or dysentery, the average treatment time was 16 days and the hospital employed 14 staff members – doctors, pharmacists and nurses.
